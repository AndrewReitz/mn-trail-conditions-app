## Where's the data come from?

This app uses the [MORC Trails Conditions Page](https://trails.morcmtb.org/),
[CLMTBT Conditions](https://www.cuyunalakesmtb.com/currentconditions), and 
[Coggs Trails Status Feed](https://www.coggs.com/trail-feed-twitter) to populate the trail status. If you 
know of some MN trails that have a status page and would like to have it included please contact me,
see this app section below!

Due to how this app works, status are posted by people, they might not always be 100% accurate and up to date. 
Sorry but that's just how it goes. If trails are wet, please don't ride them.

If you'd like to get involved please consider going to one of the trail maintenance nights,
